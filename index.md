I have comprehensive experience in computational biology through both research and teaching roles. I am an Honorary Fellow in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Essex. My research interest is the application of data science and machine learning in cancer research. Previously, I worked as a Lecturer in Biology and Specialist Technician at Essex. I hold my PhD in Molecular Medicine and Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education Practice (PG CHEP) from the University of Essex. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA).
